# PhysiQuest

PhysiQuest is an application that encourages users to live an active lifestyle by completing challenges and earning points. The app allows users to create and share custom challenges with friends and compete with others on the leaderboard.


## Technologies and Libraries

The application is built using the following technologies:

-   C# programming language - An object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft
-   SQL Server database - A relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft that is used to store, retrieve, and manage data.
-   Angular framework for the frontend ( https://github.com/Andrew-Develops/PhysiQuestAngular )
-   ASP.NET Core - An open-source framework from Microsoft for developing web applications and web services.
-   Entity Framework Core - An open-source Object-Relational Mapper (ORM) from Microsoft that allows interaction with databases using .NET objects.
-   AutoMapper - A .NET library that simplifies mapping between object types.

## Design Patterns

The application is built using the following design patterns:

-   Repository Pattern - A design pattern that separates the data access logic from business logic, making the code easier to manage and test
-   Unit of Work Pattern - A design pattern that groups data-related operations into a single unit of work, making it possible to manage transactions and achieve better data consistency.
-   Dependency Injection (DI) - A design pattern that aims to separate responsibilities and create modular and testable code.


## Architecture

The application is built following the Clean Architecture design pattern, which promotes separation of concerns and scalability.


## Installation and Starting the Angular Frontend
To install and run the Angular frontend, follow these steps:

1. Clone the PhysiQuestAngular repository from https://github.com/Andrew-Develops/PhysiQuestAngular
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal
3. Run `npm install` to install the project dependencies
4. Run `ng serve` to start the development server
5. Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:4200 to view the application

## Usage

The user-friendly interface and modern design make it easy to navigate and access all the app's features. Users can complete challenges, earn points, and share their progress with friends. The app includes a leaderboard to track progress and compete with others.
